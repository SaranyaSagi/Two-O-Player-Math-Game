- Create a 2-player math game where players take turns
to answer simple math questions
- A new math question is generated for each turn by picking 
two numbers between 1 - 20
- The player whose turn it is
...is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.


Details
players
- start with 3 lives
- lose life if answer is wrong.
After each turn 
- game should output new scores for both players. 
(1/3 or 2/3 or 3/3)
- game should not end until one of players loses all lives
(0/3) 
At this point winner should be anounceds and their score. 

Example prompt
Player x: Question? 
gets.chomp takes in answer
Player x: says if its correct or not
Based on gets.chomp and if its correct or not
update lives and display like this
...P1: 2/3 vs P2: 3/3
---New Turn---
Repeat till someone has 0/3
Just output 
Player x wines with a score of 1/3
----Game Over----
Good Bye!

Task 1: Extract Nouns for Classes
Game
Players 
lives
question_num_generator

Task 2: What is role of each class 
- Write a brief para describing role
Remember
1. State: Store data describing themselves (variables)
2. Behaviour: Defining actions that can be performed on them (methods)

Write down methods for each class 
...also speak on following points.

--> What information is relevant to each class?
--> What will they need in order to be initialized?
--> What public methods will be defined on them?

Furthermore:

--> Which class will contain the game loop (where each instance of the loop is the other players turn)?
--> Which class should manage who the current_player is?
--> Which class(es) will contain user I/O and which will not have any?


class Game
- initialize(name)
- start message
- show lives function
- check lives function
- winner function to show winner message
- new turn function to show new turn message

class Players
- attr_reader for lives and name
- initialize
- lose a life function
- dead function to check if lives = 0
- new question function with gets.chomp to store answer
and check if its correct or not with if/else

class Robot
- initialize
- funtion for displaying question
- answer funciton that shows input.
